## Resources
* [JavaScript Tutorial: Function and if statement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQxgdzr3vIw&feature=youtu.be)
	- I referenced this video to understand invoking functions and if/else if statements.
* [Code Academy](https://www.codecademy.com/en/courses/functions-in-javascript-2-0/2/7)
	- Practiced using variables and writing functions in this Code Academy lesson.
* [Mozilla Developer](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array)
	- I referenced this to review my JS terminology and make sure I understood the difference between arguments and parameters.

## Deductions
"I reviewed the list of deductions for this project and in the syllabus."

## Comments
When I tried to upload on Github, none of my JS code or branches would show. Not sure if this is because the instructions do not specify when to do commits, but it does work when each branch is committed.
Additionally, I found this very difficult and am grateful for the extra day to work in addition to going over it in class. Thank you!
